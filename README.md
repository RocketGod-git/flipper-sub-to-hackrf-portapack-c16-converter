# flipper-sub-to-hackrf-portapack-c16-converter

Welcome to the flipper-sub-to-hackrf-portapack-c16-converter repository. This project aims to convert .sub files to HackRF Portapack .c16 files using a Python script.

The primary script used here is heavily inspired by the JS files found at this [repository](https://github.com/rascafr/sub-to-c16). 
Thanks Fran√ßois for the initial work!

The main goal of this project is to convert all .sub files from [https://github.com/RocketGod-git/Flipper_Zero](https://github.com/RocketGod-git/Flipper_Zero) 
and load them into the HackRF repository [https://github.com/RocketGod-git/HackRF-Treasure-Chest](https://github.com/RocketGod-git/HackRF-Treasure-Chest).

If you have the time and skills to help improve this project, please don't hesitate to contribute. 
Feel free to PR fixes or additions.
